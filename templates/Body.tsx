                Each service includes core tasks like dusting, vacuuming,
                mopping, and sanitizing bathrooms and kitchens. Deep cleaning
                adds extras like appliance interiors, grout scrubbing, vents,

                Not necessarily. Most quotes are based on your home’s size and

              <AccordionContent>
                Standard cleaning maintains cleanliness — ideal for weekly or
                monthly upkeep. Deep cleaning is more detailed, reaching under

                It depends on your home’s size and selected service. A standard
